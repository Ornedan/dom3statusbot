* Commands
** !listen game
*** Register messager's nick to be private message'd on turn change in game

* Load configuration from a file instead of hardcoding

* Find a timed task / scheduler library
** To generalise the poll loop into a general IO actions execution loop
*** Could replace the mvar checking with pushing a quit event to be executed now
*** Also for stale detection - we want higher granularity of checks near the turn roll-over
